- Some spatial component
- Including an ecological question
- distinguish between citizen science and crowd sourcing?

- how to define what is "research" (e.g. "expert" birders are good at identifying stuff). Mary suggests that maybe to qualify as science it needs to have a set of attributes that are consistent? Statistically based experimental design, etc?

- difference between crowd sourcing and citizen science (are they actually the same thing)... consider comparing these two things

- metrics beyond abundance (e.g. diversity)

- started a list of headers for the data table, need to play with some data and come up with a final list of headers to be consistent across datasets. [Mary]
