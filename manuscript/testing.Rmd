This is a test R markdown document [@Goffredo2004]. It shows how to cite references [@Hassell2013] stored in a bibtex file (oss_marine.bib). The bibtex file contains citation tags generated automatically by Mendeley in the form AuthorYear. It throws out some question marks if you try to put in a citation with a tag it doesn't know, like this [@Adams2300].

```{r}
# this is a package Karthik made to create an R colour palette based on Wes Anderson films.
library('wesanderson')
mk.cols<-wes.palette(4,'Moonrise3')
```

Plot iris data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Sepal.Length, col=mk.cols[iris$Species], pch=19)
```

The plot has nice colours, better colours than [@Devictor2010] used, probably.
