# Group Discussion Notes
## 8/1/14
###Analytical brainstorm
**Need to think about two different analytical methods**
  
  1. how to calculate metrics for CS data to be comparable with researcher data
    - Spatial considerations
    - Density of data points
    - Brian and Suzanne: compile lists of methods used from literature; possibly look at terrestrial examples too
  2. how to compare CS and researcher data across pairs
    - how to take into account different factors that influence outcome
      - added factors to database structure
        - dataset table to include methods used by different CS groups
          - need to determine how to codify (talk to Mark?)
      - new table - Taxa table - to include data on each species
          - includes Family, Genus, Species
          - includes Adult, Juvenile
          - other columns to be determined
    - As going through data and papers, start to keep track of important factors so we can determine how to code and columns that need to be added

  - Using BIC or AIC - needs further discussion
  - Log then z-score or z score then log

###Notes from Week 2 Presentation Feedback

  -  Quality of papers: Is there a way for us to take into account the quality of the published papers that we are including
  - Costs: more data vs. quality - are there tradeoffs?
  - How to take into account factors that affect the pair analysis
  - Scale: how important is variation in outcome at different scale in terms of how CS data are being used, for example in management or in reporting on the state of the oceans
  - Data model - you can have a natural language description of the methods that CS groups use, but need to find a way to codify - Mark can talk to us about this.
     

## 7/30/14
### Lynn
- in the queue with Matt for getting set up on isis
- data searching
- started ppt for presentation

### Suzanne
- papers
    - found ~ 11 papers (with Brian)

### Rachael
- CBC data formatt/bash script
    - very messy
    - will require substantial formatting

### Annie
- worked on CalCOFI data
    - doesn't look too bad
    - wrote some pseudocode

### Brian
- Data
- papers
- formalize search

### Georgina
- made example citation md file on git
- downloaded EU/UK still needs to dig into

### Mary
- format reefcheck
    - joined ReefCheck data
    - make example analysis


## Presentation plan
1. Intro 
    - message box
2. Approach/methods
    - Examples from lit
    - data so far
    - database, paper tool
3. Results
    -  example output
4. Next steps
        

## Future plans
- holding off on further data requests

## 7/28/14
### Organization
- papers
    - going on google drive
    - no folders
    - tag data papers with “data_author(s)_year”
- Github
    - what to put on there
        - code
        - documentation
        - figures
        - analysis output
    - final version archived in a more permanent repo with doi
    - wiki
        - task list
        - car park
        - not using for now
    - possible to create website if interested
        - create branch called github pages

###Data
- can go on KNB
    - make private group so only group members can use it
- Can go on Isis
    - can make accessible for just the group
    - access via command line or RStudio
    - going with this option for now
- BTsync alternative to dropbox (fileshare)

###Writing
- write paper in .Rmd

###Dinner
- Wednesday
    - BBQ
