# Group Discussion Notes
## 8/1/14
###Analytical brainstorm
- need to think about two different analytical methods
  1. how to calculate metrics for CS data to be comparable with researcher data
    - Brian and Suzanne: compile lists of methods used from literature
  2. how to compare CS and researcher data across pairs
    - how to take into account different factors that influence outcome
      - added factors to database structure
        - dataset table to include methods used by different CS groups
          - need to determine how to codify (talk to Mark?)
        - new table - Taxa table - to include data on each species
          - includes Family, Genus, Species
          - includes Adult, Juvenile
          - other columns to be determined
        - As going through data and papers, start to keep track of important factors so we can determine how to code and columns that need to be added
